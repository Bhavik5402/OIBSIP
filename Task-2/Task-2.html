        <p>India as a country owes a lot to visionary scientist Dr. Vikram Sarabhai who expanded the scientific prowess of the nation in Space Research and Nuclear Power. His greatest achievements as an innovative scientist and an ambitious institution-builder include establishment of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and initiation of the project to launch India's first satellite Aryabhatta.</p>

            <li><p>Vikram Sarabhai who is the Aryabhatta of 20th Century India, has not yet been awarded the Bharat Ratna, while we have politicians, predominantly from the Congress getting the Bharat Ratna of which three hail from the Nehru dynasty. Now it is hoped from PM Modi that the real heroes of India get their due as Bharat Ratnas.</p></li>
            <li><p>He studied at the Cambridge and later during World War II he came to India he joined the Department of Physics at the IISC Bangalore. His doctoral advisor was the great physicist, CV Raman. The IISC Bangalore then had  the legendary giants Vikram Sarabhai, Homi Bhabha and CV Raman all at the same time in its campus.</p></li>
            <li><p>He established the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in 1947 which was the nursery for space programme in India. The PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the “RETREAT”, with research on cosmic rays. He was the founder of the hallowed Indian Space Research Organisation, ISRO, which has today grown from strength to strength with space orbiters reaching the Mars and Moon.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sarabhai was a brilliant scientist, institution builder and mentor of budding scientists like APJ Abdul Kalam, the missile man of India. He was a scientist par excellence with a vision for nation building. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1972 after his death in 1971.</p></li>
